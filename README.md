# 1. [Ng Cards AP: Beautiful Card with multiple usage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-cards-ap)
I have designed this card package to help people like me searching for a card template to add in their Angular project. This card design consists of various dynamic things which will help you to create different types of card: With Image, without image etc. I am continuously contributing to this thing and If you like this after using, consider give me a star.
