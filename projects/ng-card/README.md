# Ng Cards AP: Beautiful Card with multiple usage

I designed this card package to help people lke me searching for a card template to add in their Angular project. This card design consists of various dynamic things which will help you to create different types of card: With Image, without image etc. I am continuously contributing to this thing and If you like this please, give me a star.

## How it works

1. Run `npm install ng-cards-ap` which will add this package to your package.json file.
2. Import `NgCardModule` in your Module that will be using this card component.
3. You have successfully set it up.

## Example, Sample Usage (Basic card)

Insert the below code to the html page where you need the card.

```html
<ng-card-ap 
[Title]="'Food and colors'"
[Subtitle]="'Written by: Rohn Rose'" 
[Description]="'Some sort of description that will make this card looks better
               and you can showcase your website with good content.'">
</ng-card-ap>
```
Great! This is all you need as part of initial usage.
