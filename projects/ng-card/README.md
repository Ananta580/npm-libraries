# Ng Card: Beautiful Card with multiple usage

I designed this card package to help people lke me searching for a card template to add in their Angular project. This card design consists of various dynamic things which will help you to create different types of card: With Image, without image etc. I am continuously contributing to this thing and If you like this please, give me a star.

## How it works

1. Run `npm install ng-cards-ap` which will add this package to your package.json file.
2. Import `NgCardModule` in your Module that will be using this card component.
3. You have successfully set it up.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project ng-card` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build ng-card` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build ng-card`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/ng-card` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test ng-card` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
